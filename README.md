# SteamCode
This is a simple Android app I made in about 3 hours to solve a small annoyance of mine.
I share a steam account with my father, and whenever he needs to login, it requires a 
One-Time-Password. Since those only last 30 seconds, I had to rush to send him the password quickly.

This app takes a phone number and automatically texts that phone number with the OTP whenever a login
attempt is made. 

*Note: I would highly recommend against using this on rooted devices. The permissions required could be dangerous.*
